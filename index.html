<b>About PDX Gardens</b>
<br><br>
<p>
The purpose of PDX Gardens is to:
<br>
1. connect gardeners, orchardists, et cetera
<br>
2. via a social media that does not contain all sorts of other noise
<br>
3. the slack group is called PDX, since that's where I'm starting to 
<br> spread the word, but everyone is welcome.
