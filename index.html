<b>Welcome to Garden Club!</b>
<br><br>
Garden Club is new and starting from the ground up; this informational page was launched on August 16, 2023.
<br><br>
Please submit any suggestions in the *Suggestions* stream once you join (link to join below).  For example, I'm trying the open source zulipchat, but perhaps slack would work better?
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>About Garden Club</b>
<br><br>
The purpose of Garden Club is to connect gardeners, orchardists, et cetera via a social media that does not contain all sorts of other noise.
<br><br>
Follow the streams (chat rooms) that are relevant and of interest to you and participate!
<br><br>
Again, this was launched on August 16, 2023.  Your participation will help the forum grow!
